//Lambda Expression are how anonymous functiona are created.
//Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that contain expressions and sequence of operators.
//All Lambda Expressions use the lambda operator =>,which can be read as "goes to" or becomes.
//The left side of the lambda operator specifies the input parameter ,and the right side holds an expression or a code block that works with the entry parameter
//Usually Lambda expressions are used as predicates or instead of delegates (a type that reference a method)
//Parameter => expression
//The lambda operator =>divides a Lambda Expression in two parts.The left side is the input parameter and the right side is the lambda body.
